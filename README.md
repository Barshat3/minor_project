# Facial Recognition Attendance System

This project implements a cutting-edge **Facial Recognition Attendance System** designed to automate attendance tracking using biometric technology. Leveraging the **Viola-Jones algorithm** for face detection and **FaceNet** for face recognition, this system provides an efficient, accurate, and secure alternative to traditional attendance methods.

## Key Features

- **Biometric Identification**: Uses unique facial features for reliable and accurate authentication.
- **Real-Time Attendance Tracking**: Instantly records attendance and provides live updates.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: 
  - **Students**: View attendance history.
  - **Teachers/Administrators**: Manage attendance reports and student information.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Comprehensive attendance data insights, including absentee rates.
- **Scalability**: Designed to adapt to varying organizational sizes and future expansions.

## System Overview

### Technologies Used
1. **Face Detection**: Viola-Jones Algorithm.
2. **Face Recognition**: FaceNet leveraging deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) and triplet loss for robust face embeddings.
3. **Programming Language**: Python 3.10.4.
4. **Frameworks**: 
   - OpenCV for image processing.
   - Flask for web application development.
   - TensorFlow for deep learning.
5. **Database**: MySQL for attendance data storage and management.

### Workflow
1. **Video Input**: Captured via a webcam or camera.
2. **Face Detection**: Frames are analyzed using Viola-Jones to identify facial regions.
3. **Face Recognition**: Detected faces are matched against a pre-existing database using FaceNet.
4. **Attendance Marking**: Matches are recorded in real-time, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
